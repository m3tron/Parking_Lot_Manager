# ParkEZ

## About 

Picture a truck driver coming home after a week on the road but is unable to find a safe and adequate parking space for his truck and expensive cargo in their trailer. ParkEZ allows truckers and trucking companies to reserve parking spaces for heavy equipment eg., trucks, trailers, and construction vehicles at a safe location. By using this application that same driver can worry less about their equipment and spend more time with their families by quickly booking their spot ahead of their arrival.


## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
